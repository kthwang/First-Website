    <h3> Subway </h3>

  <div class="content">
    <img class="odd" src="image/subway.jpg"></img>
    <p class="def">The New York City Subway is the largest subway system in the world when measured by number of stations, and the seventh-largest
      when measured by annual ridership. It is the second-oldest subway system in the United States after the rapid transit system in Boston.
      In 2002, an average 4.8 million passengers used the subway each weekday. During one day in September 2005, 7.5 million daily riders set a record for ridership.
      In 2013, the subway delivered over 1.71 billion rides, averaging approximately 5.5 million rides on weekdays, about 3.2 million rides on Saturdays,
      and about 2.6 million rides on Sundays. Ridership has been consistently increasing over the last several years, especially because of rising gas prices
      and the subway's energy efficiency. Life in New York City is so dependent on the subway that the city is home to two of only four 24-hour subway systems in the USA.
      The city's 25 subway services run through all boroughs except Staten Island, which is served 24/7 by the Staten Island Railway.
      <br><br>
      Subway riders pay with the MetroCard, which is also valid on all other rapid transit systems and buses in the city,
      as well as the Roosevelt Island tramway. The MetroCard has completely replaced tokens, which were used in the past, to pay fares.
      Fares are loaded electronically on the card. </p>

    <h3> Taxi </h3>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
      <img class="even" src="image/taxi.jpg"></img>
      <p class="def">There are 13,237 taxis operating in New York City, not including over 40,000 other for-hire vehicles.
         Their distinctive yellow paint has made them New York icons. Taxicabs are operated by private companies and
         licensed by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. "Medallion taxis", the familiar yellow cabs,
         are historically the only vehicles in the city permitted to pick up passengers in response to a street hail.
         In 2013, a new type of street hailed livery vehicles called "boro taxis" in "apple green" color are permitted to pick up
         passengers in the outer boroughs and the northern part of Manhattan. A cabâ€™s availability is indicated by the light on the top
         of the car. When the light is lit, the cab is empty and available. When it is not lit, the cab is unavailable. </p>

      <img class="odd" src="image/bus.jpg"></img>
      <p class="def">
      New York City's public bus network is extensive. As of 2014, over 5,710 MTA Regional Bus Operations-operated buses carried
      about 2.5 million daily passengers 24/7 on more than 238 local routes, 62 express routes, and 7 Select Bus Service routes,
      amounting to 793 million annual bus trips. Buses owned by MTA account for 80% of the city's surface mass transit.
      New York City has the largest clean-air diesel-hybrid and compressed natural gas bus fleet in the United States.
      Local bus routes are labeled with a number and a prefix identifying the primary borough
      (<b>B</b> for Brooklyn, <b>Bx</b> for the Bronx, <b>M</b> for Manhattan, <b>Q</b> for Queens, and <b>S</b> for Staten Island).
      Express bus routes operated under MTA New York City Bus use the letter <b>X</b> rather than a borough label. Express bus routes
      operated under MTA Bus (formerly controlled by the NYC Department of Transportation) use a two-borough system with an M at the end
      (i.e., <b>BM</b>, <b>BxM</b>, or <b>QM</b>).

    <p class="def">
    The Long Island Rail Road, legally known as the Long Island Rail Road Company and often abbreviated as the LIRR, is a commuter rail
    system in southeastern New York, stretching from Manhattan to the eastern tip of Suffolk County on Long Island. With an average
    weekday ridership of 337,800 passengers in 2014, it is the busiest commuter railroad in North America. It is also one of the world's
    few commuter systems that runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, year-round. It is publicly owned by the Metropolitan Transportation
    Authority, who refer to it as MTA Long Island Rail Road.
    <br><br> The LIRR logo combines the circular MTA logo with the text Long Island Rail Road, and appears on the sides of trains.
    The LIRR is one of two commuter rail systems the MTA owns, the other being Metro-North Railroad. Established in 1834 and having
    operated continuously since then, it is the second oldest US railroad still operating under its original name and charter.
    <br><br>There are 124 stations, and more than 700 miles (1,100 km) of track, on its two lines to the two forks of the island and
    eight major branches, with the passenger railroad system totaling 319 miles (513 km) of route.</p>

    <p class="def">The Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) is a rapid transit system that links Manhattan to Jersey City, Hoboken, Harrison and Newark,
      in New Jersey. A primary transit link between Manhattan and New Jersey, PATH carries 240,000 passengers each weekday on four lines.
      <br><br>
      While some PATH stations are adjacent to subway stations in New York City and Newark as well as Hudson-Bergen Light Rail stations
      in Hudson County, there are no free transfers. The PATH system spans 13.8 miles (22.2 km) of route mileage, not including track
      overlap. Like the New York City Subway, PATH operates 24 hours a day. Opened in 1908 as the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad,
      a privately owned corporation, PATH since 1962 has been operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.</p>
